Love makes me treat you the way that I do
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you?
Nothing in this world too good for a girl so good and true
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you?
I bought you a fur coat for Christmas
And a diamond ring, yes, I did
And a big Cadillac car and everything
Cause theres is nothing in the world
that I wouldn't do 
for a fine gal like u
